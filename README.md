Viki-캍이
=========

A chrome extension that synchronizes your Viki player with someone else so that
you can watch together in real-time. 

The initial version supports only two people watching at the same time on
Chrome, but in the future support will be added for any number of viewers, other
browsers (at least Firefox), and video chat so that you can interact while
watching. 

If you're interested in helping out, please shoot me an email at
frankc@csail.mit.edu. If you have any features to suggest or bugs that you've found,
please open an issue on GitHub.


Dependencies
============

  - Socket.io
  - Semantic-UI
